Group 27:

Project: ML Benchmaking

Our project implements 4 machine learning algorithms which are Support Vector Machine,
Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron.

For running the app, it is necessary to store the database spambase.arff in the External Storage.
The log file is also stored in the external storage directory and after every execution it 
gets updated.

The app runs perfectly on Android 2.3.3 Nexus 5 API 27.
